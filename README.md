### Overview:

Scrambled Jpeggs is an iOS sliding puzzle game made as part of our two-week final project at Makers Academy. The high level goal was to apply TDD, Agile and Pair programming to the process of learning a new language - Swift.

During the project, we kept a developer's diary to reflect on our learning process. You can find the diary [here]().
