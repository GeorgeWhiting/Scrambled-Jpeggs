# Scrambled Jpeggs


### Overview:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scrambled Jpeggs is an iOS sliding puzzle game made as part of our two-week final project at Makers Academy. The high level goal was to apply TDD, Agile and Pair programming to the process of learning a new language - Swift.

During the project, we kept a developer's diary to reflect on our learning process. You can find the diary [here](https://github.com/GeorgeWhiting/Scrambled-Jpeggs/blob/master/Developer's%20diary.md).

Technologies used:
- Swift
- XCTest
